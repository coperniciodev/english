## Introducion

Today we’ll be taking a close look at the present tenses – specifically the difference between the Present Simple and the Present Continous in the context of business. 

### The present simple tense is used for:

- Habitual Actions:Actions that happen regularly or are routine.
    
    Example: **She goes to the gym every morning.**

- General Truths or Facts: Statements that are generally true and not limited to a particular time.

    Example: **The sun rises in the east.**

- Permanent Situations: Descriptions of jobs, situations, or characteristics that are not expected to change soon.

    Example: **They live in Boston.**

- States: Verbs that describe a state rather than an activity or event (like « believe », « know », « want »).

    Example: **I know the answer.**

### The present continuous tense is used for:

- Current Actions: Actions that are happening right now, at the moment of speaking.

- Example: She is typing an email.

- Temporary Situations: Situations or actions that are temporary and not permanent.

    Example: They are staying at a hotel this week.

- Future Arrangements: When talking about future plans or arrangements (often combined with a future time expression).

    Example: We are meeting them at 5 pm tomorrow.

- Trends: To describe changing situations or developing trends.

    Example: More people are using online platforms for shopping.

- Frequent/Habitual Actions with « Always »: When someone does something frequently and you want to emphasize the regularity (often with an emotional tone).

    Example: He is always forgetting his keys!

## Real-life business scenarios 

**Now, let’s envision some real-life business scenarios to illustrate these tenses in action so that you’ll know exactly when to use each one.** ### Scenario 1: You’re at a networking event.

Person A: What does your company do?
Person B: We manufacture automobile parts.

The present simple tense (manufacture) is used here because it describes a habitual or usual action. It indicates what the company generally does on a regular basis. Remember that the Present Simple is often used for facts, general truths, and repeated or routine actions.

Now, let’s head over to our next example. 

Person A: Any exciting projects at the moment?
Person B: Yes, we’re working on a new eco-friendly engine.

The present continuous tense (are working) indicates an action that is happening right now or during this current period. In this case, Person B is sharing what they are actively working on at the moment. It suggests that this is a temporary or ongoing project, not a routine or permanent aspect of the company’s operations.

### Scenario 2: During a team meeting.

Manager: Our team handles the marketing campaigns.

The present simple tense (« handles ») is employed to depict a consistent or routine action. It communicates what the team generally and habitually does as a part of their regular responsibilities. This tense is often chosen for statements of fact, general truths, or routines.

Manager: Currently, we’re focusing on the new product launch.

The present continuous tense (« are focusing ») illustrates an action that’s in progress during the present time frame. Here, the manager is detailing what the team is actively concentrating on right now. This action might not be their standard duty but is their current priority or undertaking.

Let’s go deeper with a short dialogue between two colleagues discussing a project.

Jane: I usually handle the design aspect of our projects. (Present Simple)
Mark: That’s great, Jane. I’m looking for someone to collaborate with me on the upcoming presentation. Are you available? (Present Continuous)
Jane: Absolutely, Mark. I’m currently working on another project, but I’ll be free next week. (Present Continuous)


Jane: I usually handle the design aspect of our projects. (Present Simple)

The verb « handle » in present simple form is used here because Jane is talking about a regular or habitual action she performs as a part of her duties. This tense suggests that managing the design is a typical, ongoing responsibility for her.

Mark: That’s great, Jane. I’m looking for someone to collaborate with me on the upcoming presentation. Are you available? (Present Continuous)

« I’m looking » in the present continuous form indicates a current, ongoing action or state. Mark is in the process of searching for a collaborator at this particular moment in time.

Jane: Absolutely, Mark. I’m currently working on another project, but I’ll be free next week. (Present Continuous)

« I’m currently working » is in the present continuous because Jane is talking about an action she is actively engaged in right now. The use of « currently » emphasizes that this is a specific, ongoing project she’s involved with at this present time.

## To recap:

Use the Present Simple for regular routines, general truths, permanent situations, and states.

Opt for the Present Continuous when discussing actions happening now, temporary situations, future arrangements, trends, and frequent actions with « always »..

The context and the intended meaning are essential. Always consider the situation and the meaning you want to convey when choosing between these two tenses.
