**1. Formal Greetings**

Let’s begin with formal greetings. These are the kind you’d use in situations where you want to maintain a certain level of professionalism and respect. For instance, meeting your new boss or addressing senior colleagues.

Phrase 1: « Good morning, Mr. Smith. It’s a pleasure to meet you. »

Here, addressing someone by their surname shows respect, especially in very formal situations or with people you don’t know well.

Phrase 2: « Thank you for taking the time to meet with me today. »

This phrase shows gratitude and acknowledges the other person’s effort in allocating time for you.

**2. Casual Greetings**

Now, not all business settings are super formal. If you’re meeting colleagues of the same rank or when the work environment is more relaxed, casual greetings are appropriate.

Phrase 3: « Hi John, I’ve heard a lot about you. Nice to finally meet! »

This is great for situations where you’ve been told about someone or have interacted online but are meeting in person for the first time.

Phrase 4: « Hey Emily, how’s your day going? »

It’s simple, friendly, and a great way to start a conversation.

**3. Introducing Yourself**

Now, there might be situations where you need to introduce yourself, especially if you’re new to the environment.

Phrase 5: « Hello, I’m Victoria, the new Marketing Manager. I’m looking forward to working with all of you. »

This introduction is both professional and enthusiastic, showing your eagerness to collaborate.

Phrase 6: « Hi there! I’m Victoria. I believe we’ll be working on the ABC project together. »

This phrase is a bit more casual and works best in team settings.

**4. Introducing Others**

Sometimes, you might be in a position to introduce someone else. It could be a new colleague, a guest speaker, or even a business partner.

Phrase 7: « Everyone, I’d like to introduce Michael. He will be joining us as our Lead Designer. »

This introduction is clear and direct.

Phrase 8: « Have you met Claire? She has expertise in data analytics, and I believe she can bring great value to our discussion. »

This phrase not only introduces the person but also highlights their significance.

**5. Asking for Introductions**

Finally, what if you’re in a room full of strangers and need someone to introduce you?

Phrase 9: « I don’t believe we’ve met. I’m Victoria. »

This approach is direct and can be used in both formal and informal settings.

Phrase 10: « Excuse me, Robert, could you please introduce me to Jennifer? »

This is a polite way to ask someone you already know to introduce you to someone you don’t.
